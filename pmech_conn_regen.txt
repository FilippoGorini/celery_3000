       Error Diagnostics for Analysis/Assembly Failure

  All position constraints can't be simultaneously satisfied. 
The following position constraints can't be satisfied:


1) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_2 in model
SUB_ROBOT_MODEL (component id path [40]) can't be satisfied.


2) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_3 in model
SUB_ROBOT_MODEL (component id path [40]) can't be satisfied.


3) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_4 in model
SUB_ROBOT_MODEL (component id path [40]) can't be satisfied.


4) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_6 in model
SUB_ROBOT_MODEL (component id path [40]) can't be satisfied.


5) The following kinematic loop can't be closed: Ground - body1 - body2 - body3
- body4 - body5 - body10 - Ground.

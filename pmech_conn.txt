       Error Diagnostics for Analysis/Assembly Failure

  All position constraints can't be simultaneously satisfied. 
The following position constraints can't be satisfied:


1) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_5 in model
SUB_ROBOT_MODEL (component id path [40]) can't be satisfied.


2) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_2 in model
1202312_EAMM-U-50-D32-42A-78-_1 (component id path [41,44,40,5]) can't be
satisfied.


3) Constraint of the first translation axis in connection Connection_2 in model
SUB_PRISMATIC (component id path [41,46]) can't be satisfied.


4) Constraint of the first translation axis in connection Connection_1 in model
5249854_DSNU-32-70-PPV-A---_0_ (component id path [41,47,40,42,40,5]) can't be
satisfied.


5) Constraint of the first rotation axis in connection Connection_3 in model
SUB_BOTTOM_V2 (component id path [41,894]) can't be satisfied.


6) The following kinematic loop can't be closed: Ground - body1 - body2 - body3
- body4 - body5 - body21 - Ground.
